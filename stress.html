    <h1>Stress in Sentences</h1>
    <p>
        Stress can be used in a sentence for certain effects. Usually, when stress is placed on a word within a sentence, that word will be pronounced with a higher pitch than the rest. This automatically adds weight on it which in effect manipulates the meaning of that sentence. Consider the sentence below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Carol stole my book and sold it to the hawkers.</span>
    </p>
    <p>We can use stress to manipulate the meaning of this sentence to achieve the following implications. The underlined word in each construction carries the stress.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a) That it was Carol and no one else that stole my book. <span class="highlight">Carol</span> stole my book and sold it to the hawkers.</li>
        <li>b) Than I am the owner of the book that was stolen and no one else. Carol stole <span class="highlight">my book</span> and sold it to the hawkers.</li>
        <li>c) That the book was sold and not hidden. Carol stole my book and <span class="highlight">sold it</span> to the hawkers.</li>
        <li>d) That the hawkers have the book and not any other person. Carol stole my book and sold it <span class="highlight">to the hawkers.</span></li>
        <li>e) What Carol did. Carol stole my book and sold it to the <span class="highlight">hawkers.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>Use stress in the following sentences to achieve the following implications in meaning. Rewrite the sentence with the stressed word(s) underlined in each case.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>a) That John was Eunice’s fiancé and not any other. <span class="highlight">When Eunice died of malaria, all hopes that John had of marital bliss died with her.</span></li>
        <li>b) What happened to Eunice. When <span class="highlight">Eunice</span> died of malaria, all hopes that John had of marital bliss died with her.</li>
        <li>c) What John lost apart from Eunice. When Eunice died of malaria, all hopes that John had of <span class="highlight">marital bliss</span> died with her.</li>
        <li>d) The time that John lost hope in marital bliss. When Eunice died of malaria, all hopes that John had of <span class="highlight">marital bliss</span> died with her.</li>
        <li>e) What killed Eunice. When Eunice died of <span class="highlight">malaria</span>, all hopes that John had of marital bliss died with her.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Natural Stress</h2>
    <p>Natural stress would usually fall on the last word in a sentence. For example:</p>
    <p>He talked of going <span class="highlight">abroad.</span></p>
    <p>But if a sentence ends with a pronoun or a preposition we do not stress either, instead, we stress the word preceding either. E.g</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Something</span> came up. She told <span class="highlight">him.</span> It is something <span class="highlight">to</span> fight for. They killed <span class="highlight">her.</span></p>
    <p>If a sentence ends with a preposition preceded by a pronoun or a pronoun preceded by a preposition, then we stress the word that comes before the two. E.g.</p>
    <p>The stranger shouted <span class="highlight">at</span> me. She led <span class="highlight">me</span> on.</p>
