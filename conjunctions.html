    <p><span class="highlight">While we were waiting for the bus, an old man came and joined us although we did not know him.</span></p>
    <h2>Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>
    <p>A coordinating conjunction such as and, or, and but joins clauses that are equal in importance together to form compound sentences.</p>
    <p>We use <span class="highlight">and</span> to show addition, e.g., James and John are missing.</p>
    <p>We use <span class="highlight">but</span> to express contrast, e.g., He is clever but arrogant.</p>
    <p>We use <span class="highlight">or</span> to show a choice or option, e.g., Tell James or Carol to come.</p>
    <h2>Correlative Conjunctions</h2>
    <p>These conjunctions join clauses of equal importance. They usually occur in pairs and both receive the same attention.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Both...and...</span> e.g., Both Muli and Musemi sell clothes.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Not only...but also...</span> She was not only stupid but also a stammer.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Either...or...</span> e.g., We were to either kill ourselves or be killed by them.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Whether...or...</span> Sabina doesn’t know whether she will be admitted to the University of Nairobi or Maseno.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Neither...nor...</span> e.g., She is neither beautiful nor hardworking.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Hardly/seldom/rarely/barely/scarcely...when...</span> e.g., It was hardly one o’clock when she arrived.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Too..to</span> e.g., It was too good a deal for him to be true.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">So...that...</span> He ran so hard that he fainted on completion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>Combine the following sentences using an appropriate correlative conjunction.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sarah was devoted to her family.<br>Sarah was kind to her neighbors.</li>
        <li>The boys lost their match.<br>The girls lost their match.</li>
        <li>We can go on holiday.<br>We can do community work.</li>
        <li>We don’t know if tomorrow will be sunny.<br>We don’t know if tomorrow will be wet.</li>
        <li>Kerendi refused to sing.<br>Karendi refused to say a word.</li>
        <li>She was young.<br>She wanted to be president.</li>
        <li>It was noon.<br>She died.</li>
        <li>It was good.<br>It was not true.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>
    <p>A subordinating conjunction joins a main clause within a sentence to a subordinate clause or dependent clause.</p>
    <p>A dependent clause is a clause within a sentence that cannot make sense on its own. It therefore depends on the independent or main clause for meaning.</p>
    <p>The most common subordinating conjunctions are as, because, for, since, whereas, after, before, until, while, as if, as though, except, if, otherwise, unless, although, etc.</p>
    <p>Sometimes dependent clauses appear at the end of sentences and other times at the beginning. E.g., Since it is getting late, we have to walk faster.</p>
