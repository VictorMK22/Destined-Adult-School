    <h1>Articles</h1>
    <p>Articles are very short words placed in front of nouns. They tell us whether we are referring to a noun in a specific or general way.</p>
    <p>Definite article is <span class="highlight">the</span>. It is definite because it is used when the speaker and the listener know what is being talked about. E.g. <span class="highlight">The</span> desk that you asked for is this. <span class="highlight">The</span> man has come. <span class="highlight">The</span> Indian Ocean. <span class="highlight">The</span> guitar.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is also used when talking about nationalities because they are familiar. E.g. <span class="highlight">The</span> Kenyan, <span class="highlight">the</span> Briton, <span class="highlight">the</span> American etc.</li>
        <li>It is also used when referring to inventions because they are known and studied. E.g. Who invented the computer, <span class="highlight">the</span> telegram, <span class="highlight">the</span> electricity etc.</li>
        <li>Use with superlative forms because they refer to unique things or people within a group who are known. E.g. She is <span class="highlight">the</span> tallest in our class. Mount Everest is <span class="highlight">the</span> tallest in the world. USA is <span class="highlight">the</span> richest country in the world.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Indefinite articles ‘<span class="highlight">a</span>’ and ‘<span class="highlight">an</span>’ are used with singular nouns. ‘<span class="highlight">a</span>’ is used with nouns that begin with consonant sounds like <span class="highlight">a</span> cow, <span class="highlight">a</span> goat, <span class="highlight">a</span> stick etc. whereas ‘<span class="highlight">an</span>’ is used with nouns that begin with vowel sounds like <span class="highlight">an</span> elephant, <span class="highlight">an</span> umbrella, <span class="highlight">an</span> hour etc.</p>
    <p>The indefinite article ‘<span class="highlight">a</span>’ and ‘<span class="highlight">an</span>’ is mainly used when mentioning something or someone for the first time and in cases where not all parties are aware of who or what is being talked about. E.g. I saw <span class="highlight">a</span> man run away. <span class="highlight">A</span> lady came was asking for you. I need <span class="highlight">an</span> umbrella.</p>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Fill in each blank space with an appropriate article.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">A</span> man came into the room with <span class="highlight">a</span> woman carrying <span class="highlight">an</span> umbrella. They took their seats and ordered tea. <span class="highlight">The</span> man whispered something in <span class="highlight">the</span> woman’s ear. She remained transfixed for a while before lurching forward and hugging him. <span class="highlight">The</span> umbrella which was on the table fell.</p>
