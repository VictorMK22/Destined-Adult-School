    <h1>Quantifiers</h1>
    <p>The words few, a few, little and a little are known as quantifiers.</p>
    <p>Few and a few are used with count nouns like a few desks, few boys etc while a little and little are used with no count nouns or mass nouns like a little water, little milk etc.</p>
    <p>Few and little have negative meaning and usage. Few means not many or not enough; little means not much or not enough as well. A few and a little have a positive meaning and they do not have comparatives and superlatives. These words are also used as comparatives and superlatives e.g.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Few—fewer—fewest</li>
      <li>Little—less—least / littlest</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are few girls in class. (not enough to be taught)</p>
    <p>There are a few students in class. (they are enough for a lesson)</p>
    <p>There is little water in the cup. (not enough to quench thirst)</p>
    <p>There is a little tea in the flask; you can take. (it is enough)</p>
    <p>Few and little can be used with intensifiers such as quite, too and very but a little and a few cannot. e.g.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The crops dried up because there was too little water in the soil.</li>
      <li>We have very little money left.</li>
      <li>The matatus that are back on the road are quite few.</li>
    </ul>
